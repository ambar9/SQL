# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market in India more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT 
    company_dim.name AS company_name,
    job_location,
    job_via,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg
FROM 
    job_postings_fact LEFT JOIN
    company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id

WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_country = 'India'
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range:** The data shows an average annual salary range of ‚Çπ111,175 (Razorpay) to ‚Çπ650,000 (Mantys) for data analyst positions in India.
- **Diverse Employers:** While the data doesn't reveal specific companies, it highlights that opportunities exist in various sectors (e.g., IT, Manufacturing, Financial Services) based on the listed companies (Bosch Group, Deutsche Bank).

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.
```sql
WITH top_paying_job AS(
    SELECT
    *
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact
        INNER JOIN company_dim ON
        company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
        job_location = 'India' AND 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL

)
SELECT 
    top_paying_job.name as company_name,
    skills,
    top_paying_job.salary_year_avg,
    top_paying_job.job_title_short,
    top_paying_job.job_schedule_type
